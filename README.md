# AVR_KEYPAD
Overview
The Keypad Driver for AVR Microcontrollers is a versatile library that allows easy integration and handling of matrix keypads in your AVR-based projects. This driver provides an efficient way to read and interpret keypad button presses, making it ideal for applications that require user input through a keypad interface.

Key Features
Flexible Configuration: The library supports various keypad sizes, allowing you to configure the number of rows and columns to match your specific keypad.

Scanning Algorithm: The driver implements an efficient scanning algorithm to detect button presses without significant CPU overhead.

Debounce Mechanism: The driver includes a debounce mechanism to ensure reliable and accurate key detection by preventing multiple readings of a single press.

Interrupt Support: The library supports external interrupts for row scanning, enabling the use of interrupts for keypad input in low-power applications.

User-Friendly Interface: The driver provides simple functions to initialize the keypad and retrieve button press information.

Sample Applications: Well-documented sample applications demonstrate how to use the keypad driver effectively.

Installation
To incorporate the Keypad Driver into your AVR project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Copy the relevant driver files (keypad.c and keypad.h) into your project directory.
Include the keypad.h header file in your application code.
Usage
Using the Keypad Driver involves the following steps:

Initialize the Keypad: Call the initialization function to set up the keypad configuration, specifying the number of rows and columns.

Read Keypad Input: Use the provided functions to scan the keypad and determine if a button is pressed.

Interpret Button Presses: Map the scanned keypad values to meaningful input, such as alphanumeric characters or specific actions.

Optional Interrupt Usage: If required, configure external interrupts for low-power applications.
